i am so confused....


i was trying to edit some files in multihop_dense_retrieval/mdr but my changes weren't being reflected 
when I ran scripts that accessed those files. I found a copy of all those files in 

/home/nnishika/miniconda/envs/MDR/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mdr 

but they were in their original condition (without my changes). Those are the files that were being accessed
instead of the ones I was modifying. I'm not sure why those files are in there so I am moving this mdr folder
into ~/test (this directory). I will move it back if it fucks with stuff.

UPDATE: so far, this has worked and not fucked with anything
